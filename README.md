The objective of the project titled "Air Quality Health Risk Prediction" is to develop a predictive model that is both trustworthy and accurate in order to assess the risks associated with breathing in polluted air. In this day and age, when pollution levels are on the rise, it is absolutely necessary to have a solid understanding of the consequences that air pollution has on human health in order to formulate effective public policies and make sensible judgements. This project's overarching objective is to create a forecasting model that makes use of machine learning techniques to investigate historical data on air quality and weather variables in order to make predictions about the future. The model is able to make accurate forecasts of the potential for adverse health effects at a given location and time by combining data on atmospheric pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and benzene with information on meteorological elements such as temperature and humidity.
